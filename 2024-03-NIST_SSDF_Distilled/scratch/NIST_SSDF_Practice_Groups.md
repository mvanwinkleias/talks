# NIST SSDF Practice Groups

1. Prepare the Organization (PO): Organizations should ensure that their people,
processes, and technology are prepared to perform secure software development at the
organization level. Many organizations will find some PO practices to also be applicable
to subsets of their software development, like individual development groups or projects.
2. Protect the Software (PS): Organizations should protect all components of their
software from tampering and unauthorized access.
3. Produce Well-Secured Software (PW): Organizations should produce well-secured
software with minimal security vulnerabilities in its releases.
4. Respond to Vulnerabilities (RV): Organizations should identify residual vulnerabilities
in their software releases and respond appropriately to address those vulnerabilities and
prevent similar ones from occurring in the future.
